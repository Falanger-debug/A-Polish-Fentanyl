  "aboutP": "This website was created to raise public awareness about alcoholic products. Many people lack comprehensive information or base their knowledge on outdated research. My goal is not to persuade anyone to stop consuming alcohol. However, I aim to ensure that every decision is made consciously, with a full understanding of the potential risks involved.",
  "topicsH1": "Topics of discussion",

  "topics_i1": "Neurotoxicity",
  "topics_i1_h2_2": "Brain damage caused by alcohol persists after cessation of consumption.",
  "topics_i1_p1": "German-Spanish research challenges previous beliefs that the brain begins to regenerate immediately after stopping alcohol consumption.",
  "topics_i1_h3_1": "Alcohol harms even in small amounts.",
  "topics_i1_p2": "Although it has long been known that alcohol damages the brain in many ways, the mechanisms occurring shortly after alcohol cessation remain poorly understood. Researchers from the Neuroscience Institute of the Spanish National Research Council and the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim undertook a study of this phenomenon.",
  "topics_i1_p3": "Using magnetic resonance imaging, the brains of patients undergoing alcohol addiction therapy were analyzed.",
  "topics_i1_p4": "An important aspect of the work is that the group of patients participating in our research are hospitalized in a detoxification program, and their consumption of addictive substances is controlled, which <b>guarantees that they are not drinking any alcohol</b>. Therefore, the abstinence phase can be followed closely”, highlights Dr. Canals.",
  "topics_i1_p5": "Simultaneously, studies were conducted on laboratory rats with a natural tendency to consume alcohol. This allowed for precise tracking of brain changes during the development of addiction. The results were surprising: <b>even six weeks after cessation of drinking, patients showed further damage to the brain's white matter.</b>",
  "topics_i1_p6": "With the consumption of alcohol <b>“there is a generalized change in the white matter, that is, in the set of fibers that communicate different parts of the brain. The alterations are more intense in the corpus callosum and the fimbria. The corpus callosum is related to the communication between both hemispheres. The fimbria contains the nerve fibers that communicate the hippocampus, a fundamental structure for the formation of memories, the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, “</b>explains Dr. Canals. The nucleus accumbens is part of the reward system of the brain and the prefrontal cortex is fundamental in decision making.",
  "topics_i1_p7": "It was previously not believed that during the abstinence phase, despite the absence of alcohol, brain damage could continue to progress – notes Dr. Canals. The damage was observed mainly in the right hemisphere and anterior brain regions. These findings challenge existing theories that the brain begins to regenerate immediately after stopping alcohol consumption.",

  "topics_i2_h2_2": "Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",
  "topics_i2_p1": "Based on the aforementioned study, it can be concluded that alcohol is one of the major risk factors for global health, and its consumption is not associated with any safe dose.",
  "topics_i2_h3_1": "Scope of the study",
  "topics_i2_p2": "The study covered 195 countries and analyzed data collected between 1990 and 2016.",
  "topics_i2_h3_2": "What does it reveal?",
  "topics_i2_p3": "The results indicate that the risks associated with alcohol consumption increase with higher doses, and the minimum level of alcohol consumption associated with no health risk is zero standard servings per week (one serving equals 10 grams of pure ethanol).",
  "topics_i2_h3_3": "Key findings",
  "topics_i2_h4_1": "Cancer risks and mortality",
  "topics_i2_p4": "- Alcohol consumption significantly increases the risk of cancer, particularly in individuals over the age of 50. Cancers accounted for 27.1% of alcohol-related deaths in women and 18.9% in men in this age group.<br>- The study emphasized that the risk of death from any cause (including cancer) rises with increased alcohol consumption.",
  "topics_i2_p4_li2": "",
  "topics_i2_h4_2": "Impact on younger age groups",
  "topics_i2_p5": "In the 15–49 age group, alcohol was the leading risk factor for global mortality. It contributed to deaths related to tuberculosis, road injuries, and self-harm.",
  "topics_i2_h4_3": "Global health burden",
  "topics_i2_p6": "In 2016, alcohol was the seventh most significant risk factor for deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALY).",
  "topics_i2_h4_4": "Need for changes in health policies",
  "topics_i2_p7": "The study authors suggest that health policy strategies worldwide should focus on reducing alcohol consumption at the population level.",
  "topics_i2_p8": "In summary, any amount of alcohol can negatively impact health, and reducing consumption to zero is the only way to minimize the risk of serious health consequences, including cancer.",
