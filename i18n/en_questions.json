    "question": "How long after quitting alcohol does brain damage occur?",
    "choices": [
      "2 weeks",
      "2 days",
      "6 weeks",
      "7 days"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "For six weeks after alcohol consumption, continuous brain damage occurs. This is not caused by alcohol itself, but rather by one of its metabolites. Acetaldehyde causes damage to the myelin, which serves as a protective function for nerve connections in the human brain. Thanks to myelin, nerve impulses can travel faster, enabling the proper functioning of the brain, including thinking, memory, and motor coordination. Its destruction leads to impaired cognitive abilities and neurological disorders."

    "question": "Is drinking wine good for health?",
    "choices": [
      "Yes",
      "It's complicated",
      "No"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Many studies point to the potential health benefits of moderate red wine consumption. This is mainly due to the antioxidants found in the drink, such as resveratrol. However, it cannot be definitively stated that red wine is beneficial for health. It turns out that in countries like France, where wine consumption is common, there is a high incidence of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer associated with ethanol consumption."
