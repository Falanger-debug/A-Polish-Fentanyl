    "question": "What type of drug is alcohol?",
    "choices": ["Stimulant", "Opioid", "Depressant", "Hallucinogen"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Alcohol is classified as a depressant because it slows down the central nervous system. It can make a person feel relaxed, reduce inhibitions, and impair coordination and reaction time. In large amounts, alcohol can cause drowsiness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. Unlike stimulants, which increase brain activity, depressants reduce the overall functioning of the brain."

    "question": "Worldwide, how many deaths were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019?",
    "choices": ["600,000", "2,600,000", "1,300,000", "4,000,000"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "In 2019, alcohol was responsible for approximately 2.6 million deaths worldwide. This is a staggering number, which highlights the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. To put it in perspective, COVID-19 caused around 3 million deaths globally in 2020, which is comparable, but alcohol-related deaths have been consistently high for many years. The vast number of alcohol-related fatalities includes deaths from liver disease, cancers, car accidents, and violence."

    "question": "How long after quitting alcohol does brain damage occur?",
    "choices": ["2 weeks", "2 days", "6 weeks", "7 days"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Brain damage caused by alcohol consumption can take a toll over time, and the first signs of damage typically begin to show after approximately 6 weeks of continuous drinking. The alcohol metabolite acetaldehyde can damage the myelin sheath, which protects the brain's nerve cells. After quitting alcohol, it takes time to repair this damage, and resuming alcohol consumption before full recovery can cause further harm. During the recovery phase, it is essential to avoid alcohol to allow the brain to heal properly."

    "question": "Is drinking wine good for health?",
    "choices": ["It's complicated", "Yes, but with certain circumstances", "Absolutely no"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "While moderate wine consumption, particularly red wine, has been associated with some potential health benefits, such as supporting heart health due to antioxidants like resveratrol, the overall effects of alcohol are complex. In countries like France, where wine consumption is common, there is a high incidence of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer related to alcohol consumption. The cardiovascular benefits may not outweigh the risks associated with long-term alcohol use, which can lead to liver damage, cancers, and other health issues."

    "question": "Do state revenues from alcohol excise tax in Poland fully compensate for social and material losses?",
    "choices": ["Yes, it is profitable for Polish country", "Almost compensate", "There is a huge financial loss"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "The revenue from alcohol excise taxes in Poland, which amounted to PLN 13.4 billion in 2020, does not come close to compensating the social and material costs associated with alcohol use. The social costs, including healthcare expenses, lost productivity, and the costs of treating alcohol addiction, exceed the income generated from the excise tax by a significant margin. In fact, the difference between these costs and excise tax revenue amounts to over PLN 79.9 billion annually, which represents about 3.45% of Poland's GDP in 2020. This data confirms Ledermann's hypothesis, which suggests that as alcohol consumption increases, the number of people suffering from alcohol-related harm grows exponentially, making the net economic impact negative. The costs of managing alcohol-related issues far surpass the tax revenue."

    "question": "Can the father of the child be held liable for FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) because he drank occasionally during sex with the mother of the child?",
    "choices": ["Yes", "No"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Yes, the father can be held liable for FAS (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) if he drank alcohol before conception, as recent research has shown that alcohol consumption by fathers can affect the development of the child. A study published in April 2023 found that exposure to alcohol by fathers before conception can cause significant defects in the child’s brain and facial development, which are characteristics of FAS. This study, led by Dr. Michael Golding at Texas A&M University, challenges the previous assumption that only the mother’s alcohol consumption is linked to FAS. The research demonstrated that the alcohol exposure through the father’s sperm also plays a significant role in the child's development. This highlights that even occasional drinking by the father before conception can lead to irreversible damage to the child’s health."
