        <h1>What is the purpose of this website?</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to reach people who consume alcohol without being aware of its negative effects. Many claim that in small amounts, alcohol is like mineral water—harmless, or even necessary.

            We want to reach those who, if they learned about the carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and depressogenic properties of ethanol, would choose to give it up completely.

            I’m not forcing you to make changes, nor am I even forcing you to read this material. Many people would prefer never to know what ethanol truly is because they feel unable to change their habits or routines and simply get frustrated when confronted with this information.
