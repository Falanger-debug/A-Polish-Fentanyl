            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p1">New research sheds light on the links between alcohol consumption, including
                beer, and potency. The findings indicate potential mechanisms leading to erectile dysfunction (ED) and
                the possibility of partially reversing these effects after stopping drinking.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i3_h3_1">Beer and phytoestrogen content</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p2">Hops flowers, used as a beer ingredient, contain a strong phytoestrogen -
                8-prenylnaringenin. Studies have shown that it has greater estrogenic activity than other known plant
                estrogens. The 'estrogenic' effect of this substance may influence hormonal balance in men, potentially
                affecting reproductive functions. However, it should be noted that the concentration of this compound in
                beer is low, and with moderate consumption, it does not pose a threat.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p3"><b>Abstinence from alcohol improves potency</b></p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p4">Studies on individuals with alcohol use disorders showed that up to 88.5% of
                patients experienced improvement in erectile dysfunction after three months of abstinence. This effect
                was particularly evident in younger individuals with a shorter history of drinking and no liver damage.
                These results highlight how destructive chronic drinking is to the cardiovascular system and sexual
                functions and how essential complete abstinence is in the treatment process.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p5">A meta-analysis indicates a nonlinear relationship between the amount of alcohol
                consumed and the risk of erectile dysfunction. Moderate drinking may slightly reduce the risk of ED
                compared to abstinence, likely due to relaxing effects and reduced tension. However, excessive
                consumption leads to permanent damage to blood vessels, contributing to erectile problems.
            </p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i3_h3_2">Key takeaways</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p6"><b>Excessive alcohol consumption:<br></b> Clearly increases the risk of erectile
                dysfunction, particularly in the case of chronic drinking.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p7"><b>Abstinence:<br></b> Significantly improves sexual functions, as confirmed by
                clinical studies.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i3_p8"><b>Beer and phytoestrogens:<br></b> While hops contain compounds that may
                influence hormonal balance, their concentrations in beer, with moderate consumption, should not cause
                significant effects.</p>
