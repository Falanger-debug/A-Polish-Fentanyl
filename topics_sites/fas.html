            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p1">New research conducted by scientists at Texas A&M University reveals that
                father's alcohol consumption before conception can significantly impact the development of the child,
                leading to growth defects, particularly in the face and brain. Until now, research on fetal alcohol
                syndrome (FAS) has focused solely on mothers, but these new findings change that perspective.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i4_h3_2">Alcohol and Changes in the Face and Brain</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p2">The research showed that paternal alcohol exposure before conception causes
                changes in the organization of the child's face that are stronger than those caused by maternal alcohol
                consumption. Father's alcohol consumption leads to abnormal facial development and brain growth, which
                has long-term health consequences for the offspring.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i4_h3_3">New Approach to FAS Diagnosis</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p4">Current methods for diagnosing FAS focus on the history of alcohol consumption
                by the mother, which can lead to incorrect conclusions, especially when the mother denies alcohol use.
                These studies suggest that an important element is also the father's health and his impact on the child,
                which has been previously overlooked.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i4_h3_4">The Importance of Father's Health</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i44_p5">Zrozumienie roli zdrowia ojca przed poczęciem jest kluczowe dla poprawy wyników
                ciążowych i zdrowia płodu. Badania pokazują, że zdrowie obu rodziców ma wpływ na rozwój dziecka, a nie
                tylko matki. Dlatego tak ważna jest edukacja dotycząca wpływu nawyków ojca na zdrowie potomstwa.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i4_h3_5">Key Findings</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p6">Father's Alcohol Consumption:
                Father's alcohol consumption before conception can lead to developmental defects in the child,
                especially in the face and brain.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p7">FAS Diagnosis:
                The father's influence on fetal development should be considered in the FAS diagnosis process to ensure
                more accurate conclusions.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i4_p8">The Role of the Father in Child Health:
                Awareness of the father's impact on the offspring's health before conception should be as important as
                educating about the mother's role.</p>
