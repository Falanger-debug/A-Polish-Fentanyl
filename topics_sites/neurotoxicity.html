            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p1">German-Spanish research challenges previous beliefs that the brain begins to
                regenerate immediately after stopping alcohol consumption.</p>
            <h3 data-i18n="topics_i1_h3_1">Alcohol harms even in small amounts.</h3>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p2">Although it has long been known that alcohol damages the brain in many ways, the
                mechanisms occurring shortly after alcohol cessation remain poorly understood. Researchers from the
                Neuroscience Institute of the Spanish National Research Council and the Central Institute of Mental
                Health in Mannheim undertook a study of this phenomenon.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p3">Using magnetic resonance imaging, the brains of patients undergoing alcohol
                addiction therapy were analyzed.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p4">An important aspect of the work is that the group of patients participating in
                our research are hospitalized in a detoxification program, and their consumption of addictive substances
                is controlled, which guarantees that they are not drinking any alcohol. Therefore, the abstinence phase
                can be followed closely”, highlights Dr. Canals.</p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p5">Simultaneously, studies were conducted on laboratory rats with a natural
                tendency to consume alcohol. This allowed for precise tracking of brain changes during the development
                of addiction. The results were surprising: even six weeks after cessation of drinking, patients showed
                further damage to the brain's white matter.</b>
            </p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p6"><b>With the consumption of alcohol "there is a generalized change in the white
                matter, that is, in the set of fibers that communicate different parts of the brain. The alterations are
                more intense in the corpus callosum and the fimbria. The corpus callosum is related to the communication
                between both hemispheres. The fimbria contains the nerve fibers that communicate the hippocampus, a
                fundamental structure for the formation of memories, the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex",
                explains Dr. Canals. The nucleus accumbens is part of the reward system of the brain and the prefrontal
                cortex is fundamental in decision-making.</b></p>
            <p data-i18n="topics_i1_p7">It was previously not believed that during the abstinence phase, despite the
                absence of alcohol, brain damage could continue to progress – notes Dr. Canals. The damage was observed
                mainly in the right hemisphere and anterior brain regions. These findings challenge existing theories
                that the brain begins to regenerate immediately after stopping alcohol consumption.</p>
